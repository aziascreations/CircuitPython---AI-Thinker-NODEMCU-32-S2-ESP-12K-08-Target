# üêç CircuitPython - AI-Thinker NODEMCU-32-S2 ESP-12K 08 Target

This repository contains the build target for CircuitPython and a AI-Thinker NODEMCU-32-S2 devboard that has an ESP-12K 08 on it.

It also provides the "aesio" module that is usually not present on ESP32-S2 ports even if it works perfectly.

## Cloning

### At the root of the repository
```bash
???
```

### In the ports/esp32s2 folder
```bash
git clone x boards/aithinker-nodemcu-32-s2-esp12k-08
```

## Building
```bash
make BOARD=aithinker-nodemcu-32-s2-esp12k-08
```

## Flashing
Use the standard procedure with `0x0000` as the offset for `firmware.bin`.

## Connecting to the USB OTG port
Use the 5V, GND pins near the onboard USB connector and the 2 pins above the GND pin for the D+ and D- wires.

## Known Issues
* The neopixel module and LED references still exist (I don't know how to safely get rid of them)
* The USB PID may cause problems, I don't know how Adafruit and the CircuitPython community chooses them.
